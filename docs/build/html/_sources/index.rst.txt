Welcome to PyLumerical's documentation!
=======================================

**PyLumerical** is a Python library for generating structures for Ansys's Lumerical FDTD software, and for 
performing subsequent post-process analysis. The primary focus of this libray is to investigate the opticsal 
response of microcavities; in particuar Fabry-Perot structures. However, the library can be extended to a range 
of optical structures.  

This library has been developed at Oxford University's Photonic Nanomaterials Group (PNG) 
(https://www-png.materials.ox.ac.uk) by Gareth Si√¥n Jones. It provides an interface to Lumerical's FDTD software, 
and at times uses it's in-built analysis objects, for example, for calculating Q-Factor. This library also includes 
bespoke analysis objects for calculating mode volume and Purcell enhancement.
